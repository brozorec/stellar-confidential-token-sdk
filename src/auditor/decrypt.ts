/**
 * Auditor-side event decryption.
 *
 * The auditor holds the Grumpkin secret `k` behind the registry key
 * `K_aud = k·H` and decrypts the auditor ciphertexts every withdraw/transfer
 * event carries — using nothing but the public event and `k`. No viewing
 * keys, no holder cooperation, no extra on-chain data:
 *
 *   s     = ecdh(k, R_e)             (ECDH against the event's ephemeral point;
 *                                     equals the prover's ecdh(r_e, K_aud))
 *   masks = SpongeSqueeze2(δ_aud, s, σ)
 *   plaintext = ciphertext − mask
 *
 * Channels:
 *   - sender channel (δ_aud_s):    transfer amount + sender's post-op balance
 *   - recipient channel (δ_aud_r): transfer amount + per-transfer Pedersen
 *     randomness r_transfer (a full opening of C_transfer, hence of the
 *     recipient's receiving balance between merges)
 *
 * Withdraw events carry only a sender-channel balance checkpoint. Its pad is the
 * SECOND squeeze of the same two-squeeze sponge (the balance slot) — not a
 * standalone Poseidon call, as an earlier revision of the circuit used; the
 * first-squeeze amount slot goes unused because the withdrawn amount is public.
